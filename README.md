## Overview

The Registry Center provides unified lifecycle management for **AgentCards** — structured descriptions of AI agents from different vendors. Built for the A2A-T protocol ecosystem, it enables controlled onboarding, discovery, and governance of multi-source agents.

**Use cases:** Telecom operators managing RAN optimization agents, enterprise platforms orchestrating vendor-provided AI services, internal systems with agent approval workflows.

## Features

| Category | Capability |
|----------|------------|
| **AgentCard CRUD** | Register, query (by name/organization), update, and deregister agent descriptions |
| **Semantic Search** | Natural-language task matching over published AgentCards via LLM; model failures return 503. Legacy Milvus mode remains experimental and does not provide SQL-backed approval/ownership parity: those endpoints answer 503 instead of empty results |
| **Agent Approval** | Optional manual review workflow — agents start as `registered`, admins promote to `published` |
| **Tag Management** | Independent tag entities with full CRUD, assignable to agents |
| **TLS Security** | TLS 1.2/1.3 with strong cipher suites, mutual TLS client certificate verification |
| **Signature Verification** | JWS-based AgentCard integrity checks (RS256, ES256), static JWK or dynamic `jku` lookup. `jku` lookup is gated by an operator-configured host allowlist (`jwk_allowlist` in `etc/conf/server.conf`, or `REGISTRY_JWK_ALLOWLIST`); with no allowlist configured the `jku` path is disabled (fail closed) and only backend keys are used |
| **Owner Isolation** | Ownership from verified TLS client certificates or an explicitly trusted proxy; ownerless legacy cards require administrative ownership assignment |
| **Content Safety** | Prompt injection and high-risk skill blacklist filtering on registration |
| **Rate Limiting** | Per-endpoint rate limits (configurable: 50–100 req/s, JWK endpoint: 10 req/s) with moving-window algorithm |
| **Heartbeat Detection** | Agents periodically report liveness; configurable failure threshold and grace period to identify offline agents promptly |
| **Change Broadcast** | Best-effort webhooks to operator-allowlisted destinations, with HMAC signing and version-based reconciliation; version allocation is commit-ordered in the SQL persistence modes (deployment stays single-instance) and delivery state is tracked per subscriber, while retry-after-failure and exactly-once semantics are not yet guaranteed |
| **Audit Logging** | Rotating JSON audit log (time, client IP, user, operation, object, result) |
| **CLI Administration** | Interactive CLI for agent approval, tag management, and full agent listing |
| **Custom Extensions** | Pluggable handlers (auth, audit, decrypt, storage) and LLM providers |

See [upgrade and deployment notes](docs/en/Registry%20Center%20Upgrade%20Notes.md)
([中文](docs/zh/注册中心升级与部署说明.md)) for identity configuration, approval
visibility, legacy-event synchronization, and container probe setup. The generic
knowledge-graph API is pre-embedded and disabled by default; enabling it requires
an authenticated operator and separate graph permissions. `docker-compose.yml`
is a loopback-only development example with client authentication disabled;
it is not a production access-policy template.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- **Python** 3.12+
- **OS**: Linux for production; Windows supported for development/debugging

### Install & Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/project-openan/registry-center.git
cd registry-center

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Linux
# .venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Interactive configuration wizard (certificates, storage, security options)
python -m agent_registry.init

# Start the service
python -m agent_registry.start
```

The service starts on `https://127.0.0.1:5000` by default (HTTPS). For a quick test without certificates:

```bash
python -m agent_registry.init    # choose: enable_https = false
python -m agent_registry.start   # starts on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

For Docker/Podman packaging, runtime secret mounts, port precedence and
non-interactive initialization, see [Container deployment](docs/container-deployment.md).

### Register Your First Agent

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/rest/v1/registry-center/agent-cards \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agentCards": [{
      "name": "My Agent",
      "description": "An example agent for demonstration.",
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "provider": {"organization": "MyOrg", "url": "https://example.com"},
      "capabilities": {"streaming": true, "pushNotifications": false},
      "skills": [{
        "id": "example-skill",
        "name": "Example Skill",
        "description": "Demonstrates basic agent registration."
      }],
      "supportedInterfaces": [{
        "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8080/",
        "protocolBinding": "HTTP+JSON",
        "protocolVersion": "1.0.0"
      }]
    }]
  }'
```

## Configuration

| Config File | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| `etc/conf/server.conf` | Feature switches and deployment/access settings: IP, port, TLS/credential references, IAM endpoints and identity modes |
| `etc/conf/server.properties` | Operating parameters and business policies: TLS versions/ciphers, limits, heartbeat timing, notification retry and OAuth cache/scope policies |
| `etc/conf/persistence.conf` | Storage backend: `file` (default), `postgresql` |
| `etc/conf/log_config.conf` | Audit log rotation (size, backup count) |
| `.env` | Local secrets (gitignored); model definitions live in `etc/config/models.yaml` |

Define each key in only one server file. Loading order remains `server.conf` →
`server.properties` → `REGISTRY_*` environment overrides. Duplicate definitions
produce a warning containing key names only; historical last-loaded precedence
is preserved for existing deployments. When migrating policies from `server.conf`,
move their **effective values**, not template defaults, into `server.properties`,
then remove the old definitions. The initialization wizard only edits deployment
and feature settings. The image initializes from `server.conf.example` plus the
public `server.properties`; local deployment files and secrets are not image inputs.

Model definitions live in the gitignored `etc/config/models.yaml` (copy
[`models.yaml.example`](etc/config/models.yaml.example)), while secrets come
from environment variables or a local gitignored `.env` (see
[`.env.example`](.env.example)). Built-in `openai_compatible` (`openai` alias) and `aoc_signed` profiles
provide request/response contracts, while each `models:` entry sets `model` and
`url` and names its secret through `api_key_env` or `auth.<field>_env`. The same
structure is used by Orchestration Center. Environment variables override
`.env`; restart the process after changing either source. A new model using an
existing protocol needs only configuration; a new protocol registers a profile
in `common/llm/config/model_sources.py` and adds tests.
Existing installations can run `python -m scripts.migrate_llm_config` once;
the application no longer reads or tracks the old JSON.

Configure interactively:

```bash
python -m agent_registry.init
```

## Deployment

This project is delivered as **source code only**. Users are responsible for:

1. **Build & install** dependencies on a Linux server
2. **Provision TLS certificates** (development only: `python -m generate_selfsign_cert etc/ssl serverAuth`).
   This writes `server.cer`, `server_key.pem`, `cert_pwd` and `trust.cer` at the default TLS paths,
   with loopback SANs. Existing outputs are never overwritten; protect the plaintext password
   and keys (service-account ACLs on Windows). Keep signing material separate:
   `python -m generate_selfsign_cert etc/sign_cert dataSigning` matches the public `jwk_*` template.
3. **Configure** via `python -m agent_registry.init`
4. **Integrate** authentication, authorization, and database infrastructure from the host system
5. **Set minimal file permissions** (e.g., files `400`, directories `700`)

> **Warning:** This is an internal system module. Do not expose it to the public internet without additional firewall, WAF, and authentication layers.

## Constraints

- Single-instance deployment (not distributed)
- Linux production; Windows development/debugging only
- Max 100 registered agents (configurable via `agent.num.max`)
- 1 MB request body limit
- AgentCards must not contain personal data or sensitive credentials
